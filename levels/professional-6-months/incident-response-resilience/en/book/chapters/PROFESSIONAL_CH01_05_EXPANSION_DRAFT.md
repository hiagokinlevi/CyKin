**Editorial responsibility:** [hiagokinlevi](https://github.com/hiagokinlevi). **Course:** 039 / Incident Response and Cyber Resilience / Professional, six months. **Language:** English. **State:** temporary public teaching draft; not a second book or completed edition. Consolidation target: [MANUSCRIPT.md](../MANUSCRIPT.md). All original C01–C33 and EX001–EX060 IDs, original teaching, release chronology and answers remain authoritative until integrated.

**Integration convention:** Insert each chapter's teaching after the final existing numbered instructional subsection and before its “Common mistakes and limits” heading. Insert the corresponding worked-answer expansion immediately after the same subject's EX results within the manuscript's [worked-answer appendix](../MANUSCRIPT.md#worked-answers). These additions do not change the subject count, exercise IDs, or navigation.

## Chapter 01 — Incident lifecycle and organizational readiness

**Precise location:** after Chapter 1 §1.10, before “Common mistakes and limits”. This material develops the C01 readiness exercise for a supervised practitioner without inventing an incident at 08:40.

### Readiness is a set of independently testable decisions

C01 is a synthetic inventory, not an alert or proof that its listed capabilities function. The service owner must state what an acceptable enrollment does *before* the analyst chooses which logs to inspect. For a proposed isolated enrollment test, the business invariant might be: one authorized reservation consumes no more than one available place, returns a stable operation reference, and leaves the slot unchanged after a rejected request. This is a **proposed test condition**; the current CTN cards do not prove the implementation honors it.

Separate four planes. The **business/data plane** contains the front end, enrollment API, scheduled and manual write routes, and authoritative slot state. The **observation plane** contains application audit, identity telemetry, collector, index and restricted export. The **authority plane** contains the service owner, identity custodian, incident lead, delegated alternates and their separate rights. The **recovery plane** contains an identified copy, isolated restore method, accepted slot targets and tested return conditions. A green signal in one plane does not certify the others. A healthy collector can omit a manual write route; a working backup job can produce an unusable restore; a reachable custodian may be unable to authorize an account restriction.

A responder's dependency graph should have *typed edges*, not just boxes. “Scheduled writer → API” is a proposed data path. “API → audit store” is a proposed observation path. “Audit store → case copy” requires separate selection, custody and permission. “Service owner → approval record” is a decision path, not a technical event. Each edge should have a producer, consumer, time basis, failure signal and an accountable source to ask. Unless tested with a known synthetic event and a reviewed source receipt, mark it **claimed**, **not verified** or **failed**, never “all logs available.”

The distinction is central to [NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r3/final), which places incident response within cybersecurity risk management, and [NIST CSF 2.0](https://www.nist.gov/publications/nist-cybersecurity-framework-csf-20), which describes outcomes without prescribing CTN's invented workflow. The graph and test rubric here are original teaching methods, not NIST requirements.

### A concrete failure investigation without inventing a breach

**Synthetic preparation variation, not a new C-series card.** Suppose the application owner proposes a harmless scheduled S41 write in an approved training tenant. The source audit returns a stable request ID, but the manual write route returns only an account label. The first observation can support a *scheduled-route test*, while the second prevents reliable manual-route request correlation. It is unsafe to declare that the entire enrollment API has complete audit coverage.

Meanwhile, C01's “API audit: 24 hours” has no retention anchor. It could refer to source-event age, collector visibility, query-horizon constraints or export-artifact lifetime. The last safe retrieval time differs across these interpretations. The proper next question is: which producer and dataset, which timestamp anchors the policy, what happens with ingestion lag, and what oldest expected marker can be retrieved by an authorized custodian? Adding twenty-four hours to a selected event time does not answer any of these source questions.

Finally, C01 names no after-hours identity alternate or service-owner fallback. That is a capability gap, **not evidence of malicious activity or negligence by a specific person**. Record the primary role, attempted contact, missing authority path, event that should trigger escalation and which non-disruptive work may continue. An analyst may draft a limited request; neither urgency nor access to a dashboard grants permission to use substitute credentials.

### Supervisor handoff: evidence, not assurances

Each proposed readiness test needs: decision question; exact synthetic input and producer; permitted route and approval; a positive expected row with original UTC time, slot and request ID; an unrelated S40 negative control; a collection clock and twenty-minute acceptance window; an independent reviewer; and a failure/rollback rule. The **test authorization**, **executed rehearsal receipt**, and **service readiness acceptance** are separate states. A supervisor can approve one while declining the others. The output should tell the next responder exactly which missing field, unreachable custodian or unverified route could invalidate a future incident claim.


### Offline laboratory C1X — distinguish source coverage from collector appearance

**Purpose:** Test the logic of a four-row *declaration*, not a live CTN environment. This exercise is separate from C01, from the original C1 coverage fixture, and from any production collection. Run Python 3.10+ in a local isolated interpreter; it creates no files, changes no service and makes no network calls.

The invented entries deliberately separate four failure modes. A scheduled-path declaration has the expected slot and key within the twenty-minute goal. A manual-path declaration lacks a join key even though it appears to have returned quickly. An identity-detail declaration has an identifier but no retrieval measurement. A negative-control event belongs to S40 while the requested scope is S41. Predict each state before running.

~~~python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Probe:
    route: str
    slot: str
    wanted_slot: str
    key: str | None
    latency_min: int | None

def assess(p):
    if p.slot != p.wanted_slot:
        return "FAIL_WRONG_SLOT"
    if p.key is None:
        return "FAIL_MISSING_JOIN_KEY"
    if p.latency_min is None:
        return "UNKNOWN_NOT_RETRIEVED"
    if p.latency_min > 20:
        return "FAIL_WINDOW"
    return "PASS_DECLARED_FIXTURE"

probes = [
    Probe("scheduled_api", "S41", "S41", "req-demo-01", 9),
    Probe("manual_api", "S41", "S41", None, 4),
    Probe("identity_detail", "S41", "S41", "sid-demo-01", None),
    Probe("negative_S40", "S40", "S41", "req-demo-02", 7),
]
for p in probes:
    print(f"{p.route}: {assess(p)}")
assert assess(probes[0]) == "PASS_DECLARED_FIXTURE"
~~~

**Executed output:**

~~~text
scheduled_api: PASS_DECLARED_FIXTURE
manual_api: FAIL_MISSING_JOIN_KEY
identity_detail: UNKNOWN_NOT_RETRIEVED
negative_S40: FAIL_WRONG_SLOT
~~~

A useful interpretation states why no “overall ready” flag is produced. The scheduled test is only logically consistent *if its fields were authentic*. The manual test cannot establish a request-to-audit join. The identity test has no measured availability. The S40 control exposes a scope mismatch; silently expanding the selection to include S40 would defeat the control. Neither a plausible ID string nor a small latency number independently authenticates a log.

**Adversarial control:** Replace the first probe's slot with S40 and predict FAIL_WRONG_SLOT despite an unchanged key and latency. Then restore it and replace the manual probe's missing key with `"invented"`: the code would return PASS_DECLARED_FIXTURE, demonstrating why a passing Boolean classifier is **not a producer receipt**. Do not insert these variants into the C01 case facts.

**Submission and scoring:** Produce a four-row comparison, two explicit falsifiers, a proposed request to the application custodian and a short distinction between the executed *offline code* and an unexecuted *authorized route rehearsal*. Six local points: four correct classifications, one for identifying how the S40 negative control detects scope broadening, and one for preserving the authority/provenance limitations. An “all CTN logs verified” conclusion fails regardless of the numeric score.

### Prioritize by decision harm, not by a readiness percentage

An entry marked `yes` in the original C1 fixture is a declared teaching value. Even “2/5” is not an organizational readiness score: sources differ in criticality, time horizon and relation to safety. A source needed to preserve a short-lived identity trail may matter more to an immediate escalation than several low-value inventory cells. Conversely, a restore check may be foundational for continuity but not answer a narrow identity-attribution question. Assign each gap an **affected decision**, **failure consequence**, **last defensible decision point if known**, **safe evidence to request**, **authorizing role**, and **retest criterion**.

Compare two synthetic backlog items. Item A is missing an after-hours identity alternate; its failure mode is *permission unavailable during short retention*. Item B is missing the last isolated backup restore; its failure mode is *copy existence without verified service correctness*. Neither is “complete” just because a contact number or backup job is supplied. Item A closes when an approved delegated role has been reached during a timed rehearsal and the data-owner rule is checked. Item B closes only for the tested copy, environment and target when an authorized restore has been executed, measured, compared with approved state and accepted by the service owner. Neither criterion is a generic compliance certificate.

**Synthesis and next chapter boundary:** Chapter 1's C01 describes preparedness *before an incident*. The S41 training experiments here remain proposals and invented offline exercises. When C02 appears at 09:04 in Chapter 2, do not import the synthetic PASS state as evidence that CTN actually audited anything. Instead, carry the gaps forward as explicit owner/authority questions.

### Worked-answer expansion — EX001–EX005

**Integration:** Add the following reasoning immediately after the original Subject 1 model answers and C1 original worked result. These are *extensions*, not substitute exercise IDs. The original 0–2 per-exercise rubric remains in force.

**EX001 — Why each dependency supports a different decision.** A reviewable map should include five or more rows such as: API audit → “which request changed S41?” → application custodian → scheduled/manual coverage unverified; IdP → “which account/session fields can be produced?” → identity custodian → no after-hours alternate; support → “what was reported and received?” → support lead → no authoritative backend state; change ledger → “was S41 in a permitted task version?” → service owner → addendum process unknown; backup → “can selected slot values be reconstructed?” → recovery lead → restore correctness untested. Every row states *how to falsify readiness*: a missing scheduled route, unusable key, unavailable alternate or failed isolated restoration. C01 does not supply results for these tests. A table simply saying “SIEM: green” has no operational decision linkage.

**EX002 — Falsifiable supervised rehearsal.** Define a permission-gated nonproduction change to S41, a known unrelated S40 event, the intended query predicate (exact slot plus stable request ID), expected producer UTC time, *start at actual test event*, twenty-minute maximum until a verified matching source receipt, and a separate observed query return. An approved test procedure is not its execution; the reviewer records both. Reject if S41 is absent, S40 is wrongly included, the ID is missing, the clock cannot be interpreted or the collection is late. The original C1 fixture's “yes” does not satisfy these conditions, and C1X's PASS_DECLARED_FIXTURE is only a consistency check. This prevents using a toy result to justify a real CTN collection.

**EX003 — Missing authority is an explicit finding.** The identity custodian may have delegated evidence-export rights but the identity owner separately decides about session/account restrictions under the applicable plan. With the alternate and service-owner fallback unlisted, the correct cells are *unknown/await approved escalation*, not invented names. The incident lead can record contact attempts and seek organizational authorization; the analyst may not create an emergency power. An outcome that names a responsible role but leaves the authorization source undefined is **incomplete**, not approved.

**EX004 — What “24 hours” cannot mean without proof.** A source-event retention period requires source configuration and event-time semantics. A collector query horizon requires index settings and a representative filter/ingestion check. An export queue lifetime requires request/creation and expiration receipts. These mechanisms lead to different safe collection windows; C01 supplies none. Prepare a bounded source question rather than calculating “C01 at 08:40 means expiry tomorrow at 08:40.” If an edge-of-window rehearsal is proposed, obtain consent for its **nondestructive** method; never try deleting relevant incident material to prove protection.

**EX005 — Model 108-word handoff.** “At 08:40 UTC the CTN readiness worksheet identifies enrollment dependencies but not an after-hours identity alternate or a service-owner fallback. Its twenty-four-hour API audit claim has no verified source or clock anchor. I recommend two supervisor-approved rehearsals: first, use a harmless S41 scheduled change and unrelated S40 control to verify request-ID coverage and retrieval within twenty minutes; second, verify an authorized identity-custodian path when the primary is unavailable. The application owner should document manual-write audit coverage, and the recovery lead should propose an isolated restore acceptance test. All tests and approvals remain pending. C01 contains no evidence of a live incident or compromise.” Assess the stated owner, two measurable gaps, absence of invented outcomes and usable next shift action, not style alone.

**Chapter 01 focal review:** C1X program independently executed, exact four lines recorded; its negative controls are reasoned within their declared fixture. EX001–EX005 each retain a corresponding answer and the original assessment criteria. NIST primary pages cited near factual framing; all C01 evidence remains readiness-only. Existing [Chapter 1](../MANUSCRIPT.md#ch-01), [Chapter 2](../MANUSCRIPT.md#ch-02) and [index](../../SUBJECTS.md) anchors already occur in the manuscript/course index.
